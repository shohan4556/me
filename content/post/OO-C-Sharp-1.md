## Overview

Today we will learn the OOP concept of C#.

 1. Class  
 2. Inheritance 
 3.  Composition 
 4.  Polymorphism

**Class**
Class is a template or blueprint of an object, it contain variables and method (behaviour). Class encapsulate date (stored in field and behaviour). Object is an instance of a class. Class don't allocate memory, object does.

**Constructor**
A constructor is a method that is called when an instance of a class is created.

- We use constructors to put an object in an early state.

- As a best practice, define a constructor only when an object “needs” to be initialised or it won’t be able to do its job.

- Constructors do not have a return type, not even void, and they should have the exact same name as the class.
