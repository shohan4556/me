When I have used to work with ***PhaserJs** I mostly work in night. My eyes is very sensitive so that I have tried several themes most of the themes were not suits to my eyes. So I have decided to make my own theme and made this theme which is availe on braket theme repository. 

*  Here is the theme [repository](https://github.com/shohan4556/dark-proton).
